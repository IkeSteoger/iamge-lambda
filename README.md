# Lab 17

## Project: AWS - S3 and Lambda

### Authors: Ike Steoger

### Problem Domain

Create an S3 Bucket with “open” read permissions, so that anyone can see the images/files in their browser. A user should be able to upload an image at any size, and update a dictionary of all images that have been uploaded so far.

### How To Use Lambda

When you upload an image with a `.jpg` extension, it will trigger the lambda.

### Issues Encountered

Nothing but issues!! I had problems understanding how to properly plug the right things into the right places and for some reason cannot `.push` into the `data`?? I really don't get how this all works. AWS is very confusing.
